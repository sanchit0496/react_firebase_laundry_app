üí° About The Application: 

1Ô∏è‚É£  This app allows users to book services. Upon logging in or creating an account with Firebase authentication, the app requests location permission. Users then select a service, choose a date and time (with an option for recurring service), and proceed to the cart. They can modify their order or place it, leading to the order completion page. After completing an order, users can access their profile to track order history. The profile page displays all placed orders, allowing users to return to the homepage or log out. Logging out redirects users to the login page for the next session.
